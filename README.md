# S4-Anims-to-Ult

This is a simple script to convert Smash 4 animation files (exported as either .smd or .anim) into Ultimate-compatible format.

Note: this may not work with some characters, if their boneset has been fundamentally changed between Smash 4 and Ultimate (barring the addition of LegC or ClavicleC bones).

## How to Use
### 1. Exporting Smash 4 animation files
**1.1. Sm4sh Explorer**
  1.1.1. Use Sm4sh Explorer, found [here](https://github.com/Deinonychus71/Sm4shExplorer), and a dump of Smash 4 to extract the model/boneset/animation data of the character whose animation(s) you want to port. It's best to extract a character's entire folder found in `data/fighter`.

**1.2. Smash Forge**
  1.2.1. Use Smash Forge, found [here](https://github.com/jam1garner/Smash-Forge), to view a character's model/boneset/animation data, by going to File -> Open -> Open Character and selecting the character's folder which you extracted.
  1.2.2. Navigate to the .pac files, which contain all animation data. There will be mutliple .pac files, such as main.pac, lhand.pac, rhand.pac, and usually a few others as well.

### 3. Creating a .nuanmb
