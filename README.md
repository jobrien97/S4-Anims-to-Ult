# S4-Anims-to-Ult

This is a simple script to convert Smash 4 animation files (exported as either .smd or .anim) into Ultimate-compatible format.

Note: this may not work with some characters, if their boneset has been fundamentally changed between Smash 4 and Ultimate (barring the addition of LegC or ClavicleC bones).

## How to Use
### 1. Exporting Smash 4 animation files
1.1. Use Sm4sh Explorer, found [here](https://github.com/Deinonychus71/Sm4shExplorer),
1.2. Smash Forge
### 2. Using the script
### 3. Creating a .nuanmb
### 4. Expressions
